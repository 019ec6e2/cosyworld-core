# CosyWorld Core

## Overview

CosyWorld Core transforms group chats into dynamic, engaging environments using advanced AI to foster conversations and interactions. This system crafts persistent, intelligent avatars that evolve and respond meaningfully within any digital platform.

## Core Features: ACORN

- **Adaptive Personality Engine:** Avatars dynamically adjust behavior based on interactions.
- **Contextual Response Generator:** Produces accurate responses based on context.
- **Omnichannel Integration:** Seamlessly connects with various chat platforms.
- **Real-time Environment Simulator:** Manages dynamic virtual environments.
- **Networked Memory:** Maintains a complex web of relationships and past interactions.

## System Architecture: LUNA

- **Linguistic Processing Core:** Analyzes and interprets language inputs.
- **User Interaction Manager:** Handles interactions between users and avatars.
- **Neural Network Framework:** Powers advanced AI capabilities.
- **Avatar Control System:** Oversees avatar behavior and actions.

## Launch System: SAIL

- **Server Initialization:** Boots up the main server application.
- **Agent Manager Activation:** Deploys and manages avatar agents.
- **Intelligence Core Startup:** Initiates AI processing components.
- **Listener Deployment:** Monitors and routes incoming and outgoing messages.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cosyworld-core.git
   cd cosyworld-core
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```env
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token
   MONGODB_URI=your_uri
   ```

3. **Set up avatars in `config.js`.

4. **Launch system components with PM2:**
   - Ensure you have PM2 installed: `npm install pm2 -g`
   - Start all processes: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`
